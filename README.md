# Bamazon.com
## Shop from B to Z

This CLI app has two scripts, each exercising different *priveleges* of the Bamazon experience, the first from the customer end, and the second from the manager end. Both scripts access and update the same database reflected by __bamBD.sql__.

Both scripts utilize the npm packages of [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/table), and [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors).
